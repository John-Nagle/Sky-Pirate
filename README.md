The Sky Pirate, by Garrett P. Serviss, a serial from 1911 being recovered from old newspapers.

*The Sky Pirate* is a novel published in serial form in newspapers in 1911. It
was written by Garrett P. Serviss, who also wrote *Edison's Conquest of Mars*, an
attempt at a sequel to H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds*.
This work has never been available in book form.  It appeared in newspapers, at the
rate of one chapter per day.  This text is from the files of the El Paso Herald.

The Library of Congress has scans of microfilms of that newspaper, and this text
is from those scans.  The Library of Congress has run the text through an OCR
system, but the data quality is poor, and we are cleaning it up here. For
an example of the OCR data, see

From there you can navigate to images of the original pages.  Note that the images
of entire large newspaper pages are in .jp2 format, which some programs cannot yet handle.
